        <h2><strong>What is Star Wars about?</strong></h2>
        <p class="text-size"> A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, a farm boy on a desert planet dreamed of joining a rebellion and saving a princess from a dark lord, and thus, one of the most successful cinematic sagas of
           all time was born. What began with one space opera in 1977 quickly grew into a media empire that included toys, comic books, video games, TV series, and memorabilia in every possible form. Today, more than 40 years
            after it first arrived, Star Wars remains a global pop culture phenomenon, and the story still isn't over. </p>

       

           <p class="text-size">The Star Wars story all began, ironically enough, during a period of relative peace in the galaxy. A thousand years before the events of the Skywalker Saga, the Jedi Order defeated the Dark Side Force users
              in the Sith Order, and for a little bit, it seemed the Sith were gone for good. "Seemed" is the key word here.</p>

            <p class="text-size">While the Jedi became the keepers of peace in the Galactic Republic, the surviving Sith secretly began plotting to overthrow them, working with only two members at a time in the shadows of Republican prosperity.
               It was near the end of this millennium of peace that Darth Sidious, a Sith Lord who was also secretly Senator Sheev Palpatine of Naboo, set in motion his plan to eradicate the Jedi and simultaneously seize control of the Republic's government. </p>

                <h3><strong>Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back.</strong></h3>
                <p class=" text-size move1">Listen, Empire Strikes Back is no doubt an incredible
                  (not to mention massively influential) film, but as a standalone story it’s just a smidge less tight than its predecessor. It does improve upon A New Hope in a couple of ways, 
                  most strikingly when it comes to the cinematography by Peter Suschitzky. Under Irvin Kershner’s direction, Empire is a more interesting film visually, but that’s in keeping 
                  with the story’s tone. It’s no longer a heroes vs. villains story — the Darth Vader twist blurs the lines between good and bad, and that’s reflected in how Kershner opts to tell the story with the camera.</p>

                  <h3><strong> Star Wars: The Last Jedi</strong></h3>
                    <p class="text-size move2">With The Force Awakens, J.J. Abrams introduced thrilling new characters and laid a great foundation off of which a new trilogy could be built.
                      But if you expected Rian Johnson to pick up the ball and run with an Empire Strikes Back retread, The Last Jedi was a rude awakening. Instead of treading familiar territory, or even playing with Star Wars tropes, 
                      The Last Jedi is itself a wholly original, bold, invigorating sequel. It's surprising to be sure, taking the story and characters to new and unexpected places, but every single decision is rooted in character, plot
                       development, or theme. </p>

                  <h3><strong> Episode IV – A New Hope</strong></h3>
                    <p class=" text-size move3">George Lucas’ minor miracle remains the best film in the franchise. A New Hope is such a deceptively simple story using archetypes that had already been around for ages,
                      but the sensitivity, detail, and imagination with which Lucas brought this thing to life made it a landmark piece of filmmaking.</p>

            <h2><strong>Star Wars films</strong></h2>
            <p class="text-size"> The Star Wars franchise involves multiple live-action and animated films. The film series started with a trilogy set in medias res which was later expanded to a trilogy of trilogies, known as the "Skywalker Saga".
              The 1977 self titled film, later subtitled Episode IV – A New Hope, was followed by the sequels The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983), respectively subtitled onscreen as Episode V and Episode VI;
               these films form the original trilogy. Years later, the prequel trilogy was released, consisting of Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace (1999), Episode II – Attack of the Clones (2002), and Episode III – Revenge
                of the Sith (2005). After creator George Lucas sold the Star Wars franchise to Disney in 2012, a sequel trilogy consisting of Episodes VII through IX was released, consisting of Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015),
                 The Last Jedi (2017), and The Rise of Skywalker (2019). </p>
    
               <p class="text-size">In between the production and release of the sequel trilogy films, two anthology films were also made, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016) and Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018), both chronologically set
                  between the prequel and original trilogies. A third anthology film, Rogue Squadron, was scheduled to be released in 2023, but its production has been delayed.</p>
    
                <p class="text-size">The combined box office revenue of the films equates to over US$10 billion, and it is currently the second-highest-grossing film franchise. The major live-action releases (including all the films within
                   the Skywalker Saga) were nominated for Academy Awards. The original film was nominated for most of the major categories, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Supporting
                    Actor for Alec Guinness (who played Obi-Wan Kenobi), while all sequels have been nominated for technical categories. </p>
